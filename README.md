# Design Patterns Guide

## About This Repository
This repository was created as a practice exercise for implementing and understanding design patterns in Java. It serves as a hands-on learning resource for exploring how different design patterns can be applied in real code. The project is structured as a Spring Boot application that demonstrates several common design patterns with concrete implementations.

By working through these examples, developers can gain practical experience with design patterns and understand how they solve specific problems in software design. The interactive menu system allows you to run demonstrations of each pattern to see how they function in practice.

## Introduction
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced software developers. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are typically divided into three categories:

1. **Creational Patterns**: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
    - Singleton
    - Factory Method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype

2. **Structural Patterns**: These patterns deal with object composition or how entities can use one another.
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Fa√ßade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: These patterns deal with communication between objects, how objects interact and distribute responsibility.
    - Observer
    - Strategy
    - Command
    - Template Method
    - Iterator
    - State
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Visitor

    

## Benefits of Using Design Patterns

1. **Code Reusability**: Design patterns provide proven solutions that can be adapted to different situations.
2. **Common Vocabulary**: They establish a common language among developers, making communication more efficient.
3. **Best Practices**: Patterns incorporate software design principles and best practices.
4. **Scalability**: Well-designed systems using patterns can be more easily expanded and maintained.
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Patterns help manage complexity by providing clear structures for object interaction.

## Considerations When Using Design Patterns

1. **Don't Overuse**: Not every problem requires a design pattern. Using patterns unnecessarily can add complexity.
2. **Understand the Context**: Each pattern is designed to solve a specific problem in a specific context.
3. **Pattern Combinations**: Often, the most effective solutions use multiple patterns working together.
4. **Performance Implications**: Some patterns add layers of abstraction that might impact performance.
5. **Adaptation**: Patterns are guidelines, not rules. Adapt them to fit your specific requirements.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application class `DesignPatternsApplication` to start the interactive menu.
2. **Select a Pattern**: Choose from the available design patterns in the menu to see a demonstration.
3. **Explore the Code**: Each pattern is implemented in its own package with all necessary components.
4. **Modify and Experiment**: Feel free to modify the implementations or add new patterns to deepen your understanding.

## Running the Demos

The application provides an interactive command-line menu that allows you to select and run demonstrations for each implemented pattern:

```
======== DESIGN PATTERNS DEMO ========
Select a pattern to demonstrate:
1. Observer Pattern
2. Adapter Pattern
3. Abstract Factory Pattern
4. Singleton Pattern

```

Each demo includes a brief description of the pattern and a practical demonstration of how it works.

## Conclusion

Design patterns are valuable tools in a developer's toolkit. They provide templates for solving common design problems, but they're not a one-size-fits-all solution. Understanding when and how to apply them requires experience and judgment. The patterns implemented in this project demonstrate different approaches to solving common software design challenges.

This repository serves as both a learning resource and a reference implementation that you can consult when implementing design patterns in your own projects. By practicing with these examples, you can build a stronger foundation in object-oriented design principles and pattern-based problem solving.
